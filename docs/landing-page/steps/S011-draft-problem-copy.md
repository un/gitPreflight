# S011 Draft Problem Copy

## Problem (bullets)

- PR review happens after push, when the diff is already public and the context has shifted.
- Agents and bots dump feedback into PR threads, not into the codebase.
- The result is noise: long comment chains, repeated nits, and low-signal review for humans.
- Fix loops get slower: push -> bot feedback -> agent patch -> more feedback -> repeat.
- By the time a human reviews, they are reading the aftermath instead of the intent.

## Short intro line (optional)

If you have ever opened a PR and immediately regretted the comment thread you are about to create.
